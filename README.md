# auto_doge_adder

An automatic mask adder based on python-opencv and dlib.

You can input a photo and a mask image, and then it can automatically add masks on the faces in the photo.

A demo is attached in the repository as `demo.jpg`

*If you don't have a python environment or dlib module, you can run the release .exe file.*

**NOTE: now the program(v0.1) is imcomplete. It is advised to use the `doge.JPG` for the mask, instead of other customized pictures**

when using the release version: 

The mask file name should be "doge.JPG", in the same folder of this .exe file
 
The photo file name should be "source.JPG", in the same folder of this .exe file

A small-scale preview will shown, and then "output.jpg" will exist in the same folder.
